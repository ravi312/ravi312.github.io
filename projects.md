## Project Challenges/ OER - Digital Studio

Gnowledge Lab, HBCSE embraces the use of FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software) across diverse domains - digital designing, storytelling, graphic designing, 3D printing, writing, simulations, mathematical modelling etc. which helps one to actively participate as a knowledge creator and hone one’s 21st-century skills. I have been an active contributor in designing various digital studio related project challenges for educators and children as OER (Open Educational Resources). I have also initiated turtleChat section on metastudio.org [(Link)](https://metastudio.org/c/turtlechat/35), which is meant to support educators to integrate programming, arts and mathematics in the teaching-learning process using turtle graphics approach.

### 3D designing using OpenSCAD

3D printing is quite popular among the makers’ community. As such, learning an application that empowers to design 3D models is very central to active participation. The following project challenges are designed of varying difficulty with the purpose to make the experience engaging and at the same time to hone design and fabrication skills. OpenSCAD is a script-only 3D parametric modeller. It is cross-platform free software used for creating solid 3D CAD objects.

Design challenges related to OpenSCAD are below:

### Turtle Graphics

Turtle Graphics has been considered a way to introduce foundational programming concepts in an art-based context. Its potentiality has also been explored by several researchers (Papert, 1980; Abelson and DiSessa, 1981; Newell, 1988) to introduce mathematical ideas in an exploratory way. The projects related to generative art has been used by the artist to bring the computing experience closer to the general populace. 

Created a dedicated discourse space "turtleChat" on metastudio.org [(Link)](https://metastudio.org/c/turtlechat/35) documenting new projects related to turtle Graphics using sugarLab platform of turtleArt.

Sinha,R. & Upadhyay,P. (2019, Dec, HBCSE). **Making of Great Dodecahedron using cardsheet**. The great dodecahedron is one of the Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra. Platonic solids are convex regular polyhedra but KP is non-convex. It shares the same vertex and edge arrangement as that of an icosahedron. Designed a group activity which takes minimal resource to make and can be context to elicit discussion around polyhedra. [(Link)](https://metastudio.org/t/making-of-great-dodecahedron-using-cardsheet/2547/9)

Sinha,R. & Dsouza,J.T. (2019, Dec, HBCSE). **Designing a Tippe Top**. Tippe-top has been a counter-intuitive and mesmerizing toy which can be found in traditional wood-work shops. However, parameterizing the toy is difficult to do with the ready-made models. In this project, we designed the 3D model of the tippe-top in which one can tweak the design to create different models and explore questions in a playful and accessible manner. The parts were designed using open-source 3D parametric modelling software - openscad. [(Link)](https://metastudio.org/t/designing-a-tippe-top-which-spins-the-longest-duration-after-tipping/2538)

Sinha,R. (2019, Nov - Dec, HBCSE). **Designing a Pomodoro Timer using Arduino**. Pomodoro is a popular time management technique in which a task is broken into a focussed mode ( 25 min interval) and the diffused mode ( 5 min break) for better efficiency. Implemented the smart version of Pomodoro timer with RTC, Arduino, OLED display, hall effect sensor, buzzer, LEDs and bluetooth module. This project allows one to explore the basics of electronic components and their integration which will be useful to make other projects. [(Link)](https://metastudio.org/t/pomodoro-timer-using-arduino/2468)

Sinha,R. (2019, Nov, HBCSE). **Leaf Art Challenge**. Extended the leaf art resource book by agtoys to create a community challenge around the theme.
