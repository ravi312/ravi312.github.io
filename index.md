I am a maker-educator and researcher. I have started my journey in the area of recreational Science education designing simple science experiments and toys which can be used to elicit scientific concepts and piques curiosity. 
I am deeply interested in designing user experiences and learning environments which affords diverse participation in context of maker-centered STEM education.  In last few years, I have worked closely with groups who are exploring challenges and possibilities to bring maker-focussed education to mainstream education. I was the Co-Project Coordinator of [(Center for Creative Learning)](http://initiatives.iitgn.ac.in/ccl/) (earlier, Creative Learning Initiative) at IITGN and currently working as part of core team of [HBCSE, MakerSpace](https://www.gnowledge.org/projects/makerspace.html) at [HBCSE,TIFR](http://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/).
