I am a maker-educator and researcher. I started my journey in the area of recreational Science Education, designing simple toys and activities that can be used to elicit scientific concepts. Later, I became interested in Makerspaces and worked closely with groups that were exploring challenges and possibilities to bring maker-focused education to mainstream education.
I am deeply interested in designing user experiences and learning environments that afford diverse participation in the context of maker-centered STEM education, especially foregrounding the engineering dimension. Currently, I'm a doctoral student in the Instructional Technology and Learning Sciences program at Utah State University, exploring ideas related to Embodied Cognition (EC) to understand the nature of learning in Making & Tinkering (M&T) practices. I also enjoy being part of outreach endeavors in the area of science communication.
