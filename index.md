I am a maker-educator and researcher. I have started my journey in the area of recreational Science education designing simple science experiments and toys which can be used to elicit scientific concepts and piques curiosity. 
I am deeply interested in designing user experiences and learning environments which affords diverse participation in context of maker-centered STEM education.  In last few years, I have worked closely with groups who are exploring challenges and possibilities to bring maker-focussed education to mainstream education.
