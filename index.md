I am a maker-educator and researcher. I started my journey in the area of recreational Science Education designing simple toys and activities that can be used to elicit scientific concepts. Later, I got interested in Makerspaces and worked closely with groups that are exploring challenges and possibilities to bring maker-focussed education to mainstream education. 
I am deeply interested in designing user experiences and learning environments which affords diverse participation in context of maker-centered STEM education. Currently, I am working in [LSR group, HBCSE](https://lsr.hbcse.tifr.res.in/) (at the interesection of learning sciences and makerspace), exploring ideas related to Embodied Cognition (EC) to understand the nature of learning in Making & Tinkering (M&T) practices. I also enjoy being part of outreach endeavours in the area of science communication.
